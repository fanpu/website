If you're curious about the infamous steam tunnels at CMU, or what the views
from the roof of Wean Hall looks like, this is for you! The week after course
finals concluded, [CMU SLICE](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/slice/)
(Student Leadership, Involvement, and Civic Engagement) organized an Underground
Steam Tunnels Tour as a Senior Week event. I was technically not
a senior as I am a graduate student, but they were nice enough to let me join. 

Before I continue, let me warn readers that you are not allowed to enter the
steam tunnels by yourself. Please sign up for an official tour by SLICE that
will be led by a facilities engineer. From [The Word Student
Handbook](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-policies/steam-tunnels.html):

> #### Steam Tunnels
> Because of the danger to all who enter them, the steam tunnels are locked and
> anyone found in the tunnels will be subject to serious disciplinary action
> and/or criminal action. The University Police are responsible for keeping the
> tunnels locked and apprehending anyone who trespasses in them.

# The Steam Tunnels
We met at the fence, and all of us had to sign a waiver and don a helmet (the
same white helmet that was used by builders during Spring Carnival booth).

We proceeded to the basement of Margaret Morrison Hall, and the engineer guiding
the expedition shared some history about how the Margaret Morrison basement was
enhanced to be flood-resistant after a flooding incident a few decades ago
caused water to also flood into the steam tunnels. 

We were warned that the tunnels will be hot and claustrophobic, that we should
not touch any pipes as they will be extremely hot, and to not poke at any
asbestos for obvious reasons.  He then unlocked an unmarked door, and let us
into the tunnels proper:

%}

It was initially still quite cool near the door, but the temperature
began rising as we went further in. Some sections of the pipes were
hissing and you could really feel the warmth emanating from them.
At some point I was slightly afraid that a pipe beside me might burst.

%}

At some point, there was a fork where the tunnel on the left fork became very
short and narrow. We took the right fork.

  caption="The short and narrow left fork of the tunnel"
%}

It was generally quite well-lit, until we were brought to
a section of the tunnel where we had to ascend a rusty ladder
to reach a cavern, which was unlit. It was known as the
CFA cavern as it is located right under the steps of CFA:

  class="z-depth-1" 
  caption="The CFA cavern, with flash photography"
%}

Apparently at some point in the past, a very resourceful CFA student
decided to make this their home. Not only was rent cheap (free!), 
but it was also very close to the CFA building! However, they were
found by campus police and booted out. 

I would not say that it was the most ideal living arrangement. There were
plastic bottles strewn everywhere, and stalactites growing down from the
ceiling. The air was very damp and musty, and would probably do something bad to
your lungs if you stayed in there long enough. It was surprisingly much cooler
than the steam tunnels right below it though.

We then went back down into the tunnels, and continued on:

  path="assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/another_tunnel.webp" 
  width="400px"

%}

As it got close to the end of the tunnels, we were each handed chalk 
that can be used for leaving our mark in the tunnel. 
Since public vandalism is [punishable by
caning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism_Act#Michael_Fay_(1994)) in my
home country, of course I was not going to pass on
this wonderful opportunity to defile the steam tunnels to
my heart's content:

  caption="SLICE-sanctioned vandalism"
%}

We then emerged from an exit deep inside Doherty Hall, which
was nice as it was beginning to get rather uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Whew!

# Roof of Wean 
If you thought there were only 8 levels in Wean, then you
will learn something new today. We took the freight elevator
from the corner of Wean to floor PH (penthouse?), AKA Wean 9.

Wean 9 was essentially a huge storeroom for CMU FMS (Facility Management
Services). There were all sorts of supplies and tools,
and even spare doors for classrooms. It made me realize just how much
maintenance it took to operate a campus.

  caption="Our guide leading us through Wean 9"
%}

We were finally brought to a door that led to the roof of Wean Hall, and had to
adjust our eyes for a few seconds to the new blinding sunlight.
It was beautiful!

Everyone got busy snapping photos, myself included. To my knowledge this is the
only place on campus where you can take a side-by-side photo with the
Hammerschlag radio tower:

  path="assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/roof_photo.webp"

  (W3VC) and contains both repeaters and transmitters."

{% include figure.html

  width="400px"
  class="z-depth-1" 
  caption="Gates, which is usually perceived to tower over all other campus buildings in its vicinity, look short from here"
%}

There was some open space on the roof, and I thought it would be pretty cool if
they opened an open-air cafe here. It has pretty nice panoramic views of the entire campus.

And that's it for the tour!

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank [SLICE](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/slice/) for organizing this trip, my friend [Justin
Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-sun-92b691169/) who also went on this
little adventure with me for proofreading this post, and [Joey Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-x-li/)
for pointing out a mistake in the post, where I previously erroneously claimed
that WRCT 88.3FM was also broadcast from Hammerschlag tower.
