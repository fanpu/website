I am really glad that the post resonated with a lot of people, and that they
found the content useful. This is the first time any of my posts made it onto
the front page of HN, so this accomplishment means a great deal to me. Of
course, my goal is not to write things that can go viral or which are popular,
but to write things which have value for readers now and in the future.

None of this would have been possible without all of your continued support and
readership, for which I am very grateful. I will continue to do my best
and work on writing great content! As always, feel free to reach out if you
have any comments or suggestions.
