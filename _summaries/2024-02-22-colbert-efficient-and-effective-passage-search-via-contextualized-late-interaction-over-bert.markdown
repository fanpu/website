### Three Important Things

#### 1. Existing Neural Information Retrieval Techniques

Neural information retrieval techniques use neural networks
instead of hand-crafted features (i.e BM25) to rank similarity between
queries and documents. This paper introduces ColBERT, which 
improves on BERT-based retrieval techniques by being computationally
more efficient.

Let's first survey the landscape of retrieval techniques,
with respect to the figure above:

1. (a) Representation-based Similarity: this is probably the most well-known
approach, where the document chunks are embedded offline through some deep
neural network, and the query chunks are embedded similarly but online. 
Pairwise similarity scores are computed between the query against all documents,
and the top ones are returned.

2. (b) Query-Document Interaction: in this approach, word and phrase-level
relationships (using n-grams) are computed between all words in the query
and documents as a form of feature engineering, and these relationships are
converted into an interaction matrix that is fed as input to a deep neural
network.

3. (c) All-to-all Interaction: This can be viewed as a generalization of (b),
where all pairwise interactions both within and across the query and document
are considered. This is achieved via self-attention, with BERT being used in
practice since it is bi-directional and hence can actually model all pairwise
interactions, instead of just causal relationships.

4. (d) Late Interaction: this is the approach introduced by the paper,
where the document embeddings can be computed offline with BERT,
and then compute the query embeddings online. They then take
what they call the MaxSim operator (explained later) between the embeddings 
from the query and document. This architecture is visualized below:

#### 2. ColBERT Query and Document Encoder

Let's understand how query encoder and document encoder works in detail.  Below,
$$E_q, E_d$$ provide the setup for getting the output embeddings from the query
encoder and document encoder respectively.

$$\begin{aligned} & \left.\left.E_q:=\text { Normalize( CNN( BERT([Q] } q_0 q_1
\ldots q_l \# \# \ldots \# \# \right)\right)) \\ & \left.\left.\left.E_d:=\text {
Filter( Normalize( CNN( BERT([D] }d_0 d_1 \ldots d_n
\right)\right)\right)\end{aligned}$$

To distinguish between the query and documents when they are passed as input
into BERT, the authors prepend a special token `[Q]` and `[D]` before
queries and documents respectively. Mask tokens are used to pad inputs up to
the context window length, denoted by $$\#$$ above. Why did they not 
add mask tokens for the document? I'm not sure, but my guess is that
documents are usually context-window limited and hence are already truncated
and require no further padding.

Next, in both cases we pass the inputs to BERT, before applying them
to a fully connected layer (without an activation). I'm not sure
why they denoted this by $$\textrm{CNN}$$ instead of something 
like $$\textrm{MLP}$$, it could be the case that they are viewing the 
different embeddings as coming from different channels and hence see this
as a form of convolution.

Finally, the $$\textrm{Normalize}$$ step rescales the embedding such that it has
L2 norm of one, and $$\textrm{Filter}$$ (which is only applicable for the
document encoders) strips embeddings corresponding to punctuation symbols, as
the authors believe they are unnecessary for the performance of the IR system
and only add computational overhead.


#### 3. ColBERT Relevancy Scores

With all the embedding steps behind us, how do we compute a score between
a query $$q$$ and document $$d$$? To do this, the authors used the
following formulation of relevancy scores $$S_{q,d}$$:

$$S_{q, d}:=\sum_{i \in\left[\left|E_q\right|\right]} \max _{j \in\left[\left|E_d\right|\right]} E_{q_i} \cdot E_{d_j}^T$$

This is saying that the score between $$q$$ and $$d$$ is computed by first going
through the embeddings of every single token in the query, and then 
finding the embedding in the document that maximizes their dot product, 
which is a measure of how similar the two embeddings are. 

Their formulation is somewhat reminiscent of Gaussian complexity, where we try
to understand how expressive a function class $$K$$ is based on how well it can
fit random noise:

$$\mathcal{G}(K)=\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, I_d \right)}\left[\sup _{\theta \in K}\langle\epsilon, \theta\rangle\right]$$

Finally, to train ColBERT, they used triples $$\langle q, d^+, d^- \rangle$$
containing the query $$q$$, a positive document $$d^+$$ and negative document
$$d^-$$ to minimize the softmax cross-entropy loss.

### Most Glaring Deficiency

At the end of the day, I did not really find this paper very novel, as their main
technical contribution is just how they computed the relevancy scores
when viewed from the lens of the representation-based similarity approach
(as this already makes use of late interaction).

Indeed, this technique could have also been extended to work with
representation-based similarity, and so I feel like they missed a chance to
solve a more general problem which seemed quite obvious.

However, I'll admit I may have been unable to fully appreciate the merits of
this paper, as I'm not very well-versed in the information retrieval
literature.

### Conclusions for Future Work
The technique of late interaction can be used to optimize systems, since it
offers opportunities for offline pre-computation, and also may require less data
to be processed at once (which can be an issue for superlinear-scaling
algorithms like Transformers), at the cost of potentially slightly worse
performance.
