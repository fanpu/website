### Three Important Things

#### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Language Models

Chain-of-thought prompting is a few-shot prompting technique
where exemplars provided include reasoning steps on how the 
answer is arrived at. This results in a significant improvement
for large language models in multi-step reasoning tasks like arithmetic
questions. It is robust to differences in the prompting style.

#### 2. Emergent Property of Large Language Models
The success of chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent property of large
language models, but on the contrary could hurt performance for smaller models
as compared to standard prompting.
It is an interesting future direction to understand how this
technique also be adapted to smaller models.

#### 3. Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Works
Ablation studies were performed to understand how
chain-of-thought prompting works, and if there are other
techniques to replicate the results.

This included:
1. Verbalizing mathematical equations related to the problem,
2. Spending extra dummy tokens equivalent to the difficulty of the
problem to obtain more intermediate tokens for computation,
3. Adding reasoning steps after the answer, under the suspicion
that the reasoning prompt helps to access relevant knowledge.

All of them performed only near baseline levels, indicating 
that there may be something unique to chain-of-thought prompting.

### Most Glaring Deficiency
Visualizing the attention maps may be able to provide some insights
into the inner workings of chain-of-thought prompting, but was not
performed.

### Conclusions for Future Work
While generalized abstract multi-step reasoning and planning is currently still
out of our reach, we can try to break down the task as much as possible using
techniques like chain-of-thought prompting as an intermediate step. 

Furthermore, it will also be interesting to further understand
how this chain-of-thought property emerges as a result of larger
language model sizes, to allow us to understand how further reasoning
capabilities can be developed.
