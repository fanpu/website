### Three Important Things

#### 1. Ground Truth Labels Matter Little
This paper aims to make headway in understanding why in-context learning works.
In-context learning, also known as few-shot learning, is where a few examples
of input-label pairs are supplied to the model as part of the prompt.

Surprisingly, the authors found that randomizing the labels only had a slight
impact on the accuracy of tasks that GPT-3 was evaluated on, and still performed
much better than when no labels were supplied:

    path="/assets/img/summaries/in-context-random.webp"
    width="600px"
    class="z-depth-1"
%}

#### 2. Number of Correct Labels Does Not Matter

The authors also tried varying the proportion of correct labels
supplied (out of 16 in-context examples), and found that this did
not really affect accuracy:

{% include figure.html
    path="/assets/img/summaries/in-context-varying.webp"
    width="600px"
    class="z-depth-1"
%}

#### 3. Why In-Context Learning Works

The previous two observations hence suggest that the performance gains from
in-context learning vs zero-shot learning is due to the specification of the
input space and label space to the model, and not because the model
actually tries to learn from the supplied input-label pairs.

In fact, based on the results the model largely ignores the correspondence of
the input-label pairs, and instead uses its own priors during pretraining for
the output.

### Most Glaring Deficiency
As noted in the paper, a key limitation of this result is that the tasks evaluated
on are all NLP tasks, where the model already has some strong priors from pretraining.
It could be possible that having gold (i.e ground truth) labels becomes more important
for more specialized tasks.

### Conclusions for Future Work
Even if we only have unsupervised data, we can still benefit from few-shot
learning by assigning these unsupervised samples some labels from the expected
target distribution.
