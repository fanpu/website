### Three Important Things

#### 1. MIPRO

This paper introduces MIPRO (Multi-prompt Instruction PRoposal Optimizer) for
optimizing multi-stage prompts. Multi-stage here means that there is a chain of
LLM calls required to solve the task, usually done so that a complex task is
broken down into simpler sub-tasks.

The paper builds on OPRO (see paper summary
[here]({% link _summaries/2024-07-13-large-language-models-as-optimizers.markdown %})), and generalizes it to multiple stages. It also 
optimizes both instructions and few-shot examples, instead of purely 
instructions in the case of OPRO.

#### 2. Bayesian Surrogate Model

It was disappointing that the paper was not clear on how MIPRO works exactly,
in particular how the Bayesian optimization part fits in.

From my understanding, MIPRO works as follows:

* There are many modules to optimize (stages in the LLM pipeline)
* Each module has instructions and demonstrations that can be optimized
* It uses the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator as a surrogate model to decide
* which modules to optimize,
and then come up with a partial assignment of new values for those variables

Why the surrogate model? In Bayesian optimization, the objective is assumed to
be expensive to evaluate, and therefore we make use of a cheaper surrogate model
which is a proxy of the objective function.  The surrogate model thus helps to
decide which point to evaluate next.

However, since this is only a partial assignment, it was unclear 
how the assignments of the other modules were decided.

#### 3. Results

They had a few variations of MIPRO, but the most important distinction is
between whether they optimized instructions only (0-shot), demonstrations only
(few-shot), or both.

The table above shows that on almost all tasks except for HotPotQA Cond, optimizing for demonstrations only outperforms optimizing for instructions only,
sometimes by a significant margin. 

The only exception was HotPotQA Cond, a dataset they created off HotPotQA that
had more complicated conditional logic in it which was hard to elicit fully with
just examples.

### Most Glaring Deficiency

The most interesting part of the paper was not well-explained.  I am not an
expert in Bayesian optimization and was unable to confidently understand how
their optimization framework works even after re-reading several times and also
going through the description of the algorithm in the appendix.  An example
run-through would have been helpful.

### Conclusions for Future Work

Improving few-shot examples are more helpful for improving performance when
instructions are not too complicated.

When instructions are complicated, optimizing for those is more helpful.
