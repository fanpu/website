### Four Important Things

#### 1. Power Law Relationship of $$L$$ With Respect To $$N, C, D$$

The paper shows empirically that language modeling loss $$L$$ is a predictable function of:

- $$N$$, the number of model parameters (excluding embeddings).
- $$D$$, the size of the dataset,
- $$C$$, the amount of compute used for training,

when they are not bottlenecked by any of the other two parameters.

The paper also observed that larger models are more sample-efficient than smaller models,
being able to reach the same loss with fewer samples.

In the graph below, we see that the curves corresponding to the $$10^9$$
parameter model achieves a much smaller test loss compared to the $$10^3$$ parameter model
at all regimes:

%}

In addition, they surprisingly found that for a fixed compute budget and no
restrictions on model size or available data, the optimal loss that can be
achieved is not by training a model to convergence, but rather training a very
large model that significantly stops short of convergence. One's intuition
for smaller models would be that models should be trained to convergence,
and this often happens in practice due to hardware constraints.

In the graph below, we see that the curves flatten out towards the end with
increasing compute, which provides intuition on why it is preferable to
over-parameterize the model further in order to stay within the non-flattening
regime of decaying test loss:

#### 2. Transformer Performance Depends Weakly on Shape Parameters

We parameterize the Transformer architecture by the following hyperparameters:

- $$n_{\textrm{layer}}$$, the number of Transformer block layers
- $$d_{\textrm{model}}$$, the dimension of the residual stream (i.e the dimensions output
  by the residual connection and layer normalization components, which is the dimension preserved
  between each Transformer block)
- $$d_{\textrm{ff}}$$, the dimension of the feed-forward layer
- $$d_{\textrm{attn}}$$, the dimension of the attention output
- $$n_{\textrm{heads}}$$, the number of attention heads per layer

To jolt your memory of how these different components come together again,
here's the original Transformer architecture from Vaswani et. al:

    class="z-depth-1"

The authors showed that the performance of Transformers only depends weakly
on $$n_{\textrm{layer}}$$, $$n_{\textrm{heads}}$$, and $$d_{\textrm{ff}}$$
when the total number of parameters is held fixed. It was not elaborated
what "weakly" means precisely, but I understood it to mean that the relationship
is something that would be swallowed in the context of big-O analysis.

To study the relationships of performance on these hyperparameters,
they always scaled
$$d_{\mathrm{model}}$$ accordingly to keep $$N \approx 12 n_{\mathrm{layer}}
d_{\mathrm{model}}^2 $$ fixed.
$$d\_{\mathrm{model}}$$ controls the width of the Transformer, and makes
sense to be the one modified since it can allow the most significant parameter.
changes without changing its own value too significantly.

1. (Right plot) For $$n_{\mathrm{heads}}$$, we see that loss increases as
   $$n_{\mathrm{heads}}$$ decreases, but this can be offset by increasing
   $$d_{\mathrm{model}}$$, which leads to their remark in the plot.

2. (Middle plot) For $$n_{\mathrm{layer}}$$, as the number of layer decreases
   and $$d_{\mathrm{model}}$$ increases, the loss increase goes down and then
   goes up again across a range of architectures with different $$N$$.
   This means there is a sweet spot for trading off between the two parameters.

3. (Left plot) For $$d_{\mathrm{ff}}$$, as $$d_{\mathrm{ff}}$$ increases
   and $$d_{\mathrm{model}}$$ decreases, the increase in loss goes down
   slightly, before growing a lot more. This also hints at a sweet
   spot between the two parameters.

The fact that the loss only weakly depends on model shape is desirable since it
makes the analysis of scaling laws more robust (minor changes in architecture should
not result in major changes in the results, much like how minor tweaks to the Turing
machine architecture should not change asymptotic analysis significantly).

#### 3. Comparisons with LSTMs

It would be interesting to understand how the scaling laws of Transformers compare to the classical LSTM.

    path="/assets/img/summaries/scaling_laws_lstm.webp"
    width="800px"
    class="z-depth-1"
%}

On the left plot, we see that the test loss of Transformers asymptotically beat
that of LSTMs.

On the right plot (red plots are for LSTM, blue plots for Transformers), we see that
while LSTM and Transformer curves have lower per-token losses at all indices as the number of parameters
increases, this trend plateaus for LSTMs beyond some token index, but continues to decay
for Transformers. The per-token loss should decrease as the index increases since there is more
context to constrain the possibilities of the next token.

#### 4. Generalization Among Data Distributions

The authors also verified that the scaling laws hold
for different data distributions:

### Most Glaring Deficiency

I thought the paper was generally very comprehensive and analyzed the scaling
laws from many different dimensions. However, it could have gone a step further
to distill the learnings from the results to provide concrete guidelines on
how to choose $$N, C, D$$ when training LLMs.

### Conclusions for Future Work

Given a fixed compute budget, one can choose $$N, D$$ appropriately to achieve a desired loss.

While the paper provided empirical evidence for the scaling laws, there is not
yet any theoretical understanding of why this is the case, which would be an interesting
line of future research.
