### Three Important Things

#### 1. Iterative Retrieval-Generation Synergy

Instead of just retrieving context and generating a response for RAG just once,
we can iteratively perform this pgocess and give the LLM the opportunity to
retrieve more relevant information in the next iteration. This is because there
may be a semantic gap between the original question and the context needed to
answer it.

For instance, in the example below which requires multi-hop reasoning, the model
first retrieves that Jesse Hogan was the player who won the award, however
hallucinated the wrong height.

During the second retrieval, it was able to retrieve the right context
with the actual height, and can now craft the final answer.

{% include figure.html
    path="/assets/img/summaries/iter_ret_example.webp"
    width="600px"
    class="z-depth-1"
%}

They call their technique ITER-RETGEN. It works as follows:

1. Start with user question $$q$$
2. Query initial paragraphs $$D_{q}$$
3. Get answer generation $$y_1$$
4. Query new context given query and first geneartion, $$D_{y_1 \|\| q}$$
5. Get answer generation $$y_2$$
6. ...and so on, until we have all $$T$$ iterations. 
7. Return $$y_T$$ as the final response

#### 2. Evaluation Format

They used the following prompt to determine if the RAG answer is correct.
They eschewed exact match (EM) metrics as it significantly understates the
performance of the system, and was not sensitive to actual improvements in it.
They called this method of evaluation Acc$$^\dagger$$.

```
In the following task, you are given a
Question, a model Prediction for the
Question, and a Ground-truth Answer to the
Question. You should decide whether the
model Prediction implies the Ground-truth
Answer.

Question
{question}

Prediction
{model output}

Ground-truth Answer
{answer}

Does the Prediction imply the Ground-truth
Answer? Output Yes or No:
```

#### 3. Results

{% include figure.html
    path="/assets/img/summaries/iter_ret_results.webp"
    width="600px"
    class="z-depth-1"
%}

They found that the second iteration brought the most performance boost, and
higher iterations generally performed better. The second iteration (ITER-RETGEN 2) was competitive with other SOTA methods like ReAct, Self-Ask, and DSP.

They also validated that their Acc$$^\dagger$$ metrics were more accurate than
EM by manually inspecting samples, and finding that in the overwhelming majority
of the cases where Acc$$^\dagger$$ and EM disagrees, Acc$$^\dagger$$ was
correct.

### Most Glaring Deficiency

In practice due to varying difficulty of tasks it may be interesting to explore
taking an adaptive number of steps based on whether the model now already has
enough knowledge to answer the question.

In addition, there may also be value to keeping previously retrieved context,
which could be explored.

### Conclusions for Future Work

I suspect this paradigm works because it can be viewed as a form of 
advanced query re-writing, where the query now looks very similar to the target
data due to inclusion of similarly relevant data chunks.
