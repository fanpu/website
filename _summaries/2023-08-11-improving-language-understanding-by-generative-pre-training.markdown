### Three Important Things

#### 1. Generative Pre-Training
The authors introduce a paradigm for language models where it undergoes
unsupervised generative pre-training on a large corpus of unlabeled data, before undergoing
fine-tuning on supervised data for a specific task. They show that language pre-training results
in significant performance gains on various NLP tasks.

#### 2. Traversal-Style Architecture for Different NLP Tasks
Different NLP tasks have different input-output structure formats. For instance, while classification
takes in the text to classify as input, and outputs the predicted class, other tasks like multiple choice could contain
a single context and multiple answers to choose from.

To avoid having to retrain them for different tasks, the authors came up with a
traversal-style approach such that the same pre-trained Transformer model can be
applied to all of them, given in the figure below.

#### 3. Including Language Modeling as an Auxiliary Objective to Fine-Tuning
During the unsupervised pre-training step, the following log-likelihood objective is maximized:

$$ L_1(\mathcal{U}) = \sum_i \log P(u_i \mid u_{i-k}, \cdots, u_{i-1}; \Theta),$$

where
- $$\mathcal{U} = \{ u_1, \cdots, u_n \}$$ are the input tokens,
- $$\Theta$$ are the parameters for the neural network,
- $$P$$ is the probability.

Next, during the supervised fine-tuning step, traditionally only the log-likelihood
of the supervised labels given the inputs is maximized:

$$L_2 (\mathcal{C}) = \sum_{(x,y)} \log P(y \mid x^1, \cdots, x^m),$$

where
- $$x^1, \cdots, x^m$$ are the input tokens,
- $$y$$ is the label.

However, the authors experimented with also adding $$L_1(\mathcal{C})$$, the
objective from the unsupervised pre-training step as an auxiliary objective,
multiplied by some scaling factor $$\lambda$$ to obtain the following final loss
function:

$$L_3(\mathcal{C}) = L_2(\mathcal{C}) + \lambda \times L_1(\mathcal{C}).$$

%}

An ablation study of the inclusion of the auxiliary objective (ie the $$\lambda \times
L_1(\mathcal{C})$$ term) is given in the table above. The authors note that the
auxiliary objective helps with performance on larger datasets, but harms for
smaller datasets.

### Most Glaring Deficiency
Could have also performed an analysis on the effect of varying the size of the
pre-training corpus (in addition to pre-training updates), on the final result
of the final fine-tuned NLP tasks.

### Conclusions for Future Work
The paper introduced a useful generative pre-training paradigm that is now
standard for many LLM applications.
