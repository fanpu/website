### Three Important Things

#### 1. LoRA

This paper introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which is a technique for efficient fine-tuning.

In normal fine-tuning, all the parameters of the model are updated. However,
this is expensive and not practical for large models on consumer hardware.

On the other hand, in LoRA, the pre-trained parameters are frozen, and only a
low-dimensional subset of the parameters are trainable.

For instance, in the case of a weight matrix (i.e the projection matrices for
query/key/values/outputs in Transformers), if $$W_0 \in \R^{d \times k}$$
represents the original weight matrix, then instead of learning a new fine-tuned
$$W$$ that requires all $$dk$$ parameters to be updated, we can factorize this
update $$W = W_0 + \Delta W$$
with low-rank decomposition $$\Delta W = BA$$, where $$B \in \R^{d \times r}, A
\in \R^{r \times k}$$, where $$r$$ is significantly smaller than $$d$$ and
$$k$$. In this way, we only have to update $$r(d+k)$$ parameters instead.

The diagram above illustrates how this works. $$A$$ is initialized with random Gaussians, and
$$B$$ is initialized with zero. During the forward pass, the input $$x$$ can be applied to both
the pre-trained weights and the low-rank adaptation layer, and summed up:

$$h=W_0 x+\Delta W x=W_0 x+B A x$$

In the paper, they compare LoRA with existing techniques for efficient fine-tuning:

1. Adapter Layers: this introduces adding additional adapter layers that contain relatively few parameters
   and hence doesn't add much in the way of overall computation.
   However, the downside is that these adapter layers still must be processed sequentially, which presents
   an additional latency cost for inference.

2. Prefix-tuning: Another approach is prefix tuning, where a special prefix is
   prepended to adapt it to the task at hand. However, optimizing for this prefix
   is hard, and it also reduces the remaining amount of tokens for the task.

#### 2. LoRA Benefits

Empirically, even with very low rank, LoRA performs competitively against full-parameter fine-tuning
and even surpasses it:

It's possible to fine-tune many different light-weight adapters for different
tasks using the same base model. During inference time, you can dynamically swap
out for the appropriate $$A, B$$ matrices for the task at hand while sharing the
same base model, allowing you to serve many different models without having to
incur the cost of needing to provision an equivalent number of full-parameter
fine-tuned models.

In fact, there are startups like [Predibase](https://predibase.com/) whose business
model is doing precisely this for customers.

#### 3. Why LoRA Works

The author's original motivation for LoRA is that over-parameterized models have intrinsic low-rank structures after training, and so only a low-rank update is required to fine-tune a pre-trained model.

To do so, they analyzed the subspace similarity of the $$A_{r=8}$$ and $$A_{r=64}$$,
which is the first adapter matrix that the input is projected onto of rank 8 and 64 respectively.

Given some matrix $$A$$, you can perform the SVD decomposition $$A = U \Sigma V^T$$, where both $$U, V$$
are orthonormal matrices. To compare subspace similarity, they compared $$U_{A_{r=8}}$$ and
$$U_{A_{r=64}}$$, which is in the span of $$A_{r=8}$$ and $$A_{r=64}$$ respectively, using Grassman distance:

$$\phi\left(A_{r=8}, A_{r=64}, i, j\right)=\frac{\left\|U_{A_{r=8}}^{i \top} U_{A_{r=64}}^j\right\|_F^2}{\min (i, j)} \in[0,1],$$

where $$U^i_{A_{r=8}}$$ are the columns of $$U_{A_{r=8}}$$ truncated to the top-$$i$$ singular vectors,
and similarly for $$U^i_{A_{r=64}}$$.

To understand what the metric is doing, it is saying that when we consider only
the top $$i$$ and $$j$$ singular vectors of $$U^i_{A_{r=8}}$$ and
$$U^i_{A_{r=64}}$$ respectively, and take all the pairwise dot-product
of their columns, which gives $$i * j$$ dot products. However, the maximum
sum that can be achieved is $$\min(i, j)$$, since it is constrained by the rank of the smaller subspace,
and hence we normalize by that factor.

Here are the results:

From the plots, we see that there is strong subspace similarity when just taking
the top $$i$$ singular values for $$U^i_{A_{r=8}}$$ against $$U^i_{A_{r=64}}$$
for any $$j$$, and this begins to decay as $$i$$ increases. In fact, when
$$i=1$$ the Grassman distance was over 0.5, which was corroborated by their
empirical results that even rank 1 LoRA performed well.

This shows that a low-rank adapter is sufficient for LoRA to capture the direction of most of the
interesting changes.

### Most Glaring Deficiency

I am not sure why the weight matrices for the feedforward networks were not
included in the components which the authors experimented with applying LoRA to.
They considered the key, query, value matrices in self-attention, as well as the
output projection matrices for multi-head attention. The feedforward networks
seemed like another clear place to try.

### Conclusions for Future Work

The more we understand the inner workings of a problem, the more we can exploit
its idiosyncrasies to achieve some sort of relaxation that still respects the
general properties of the problem. In this case, both empirical and theoretical
understanding of the low-rank structure of updates gave birth to this
highly-influential method used for fine-tuning LLMs and diffusion models today.
