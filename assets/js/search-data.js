The same notion can be extended to the streaming model. The problem of finding a nonzero element from a turnstile stream is previously shown to require linear space for both deterministic and pseudo-deterministic algorithms. Another model of streaming problems is that of graphs, where edge insertions and deletions occur along a stream. Some natural problems include connectivity, bipartiteness, and colorability of a graph. While the randomized and deterministic graph streaming algorithms have been mostly well-studied, we investigate pseudo-deterministic space lower bounds and upper bounds for graph theoretic streaming problems.",

In particular, we consider both HAR-DRD, based on the DRD decomposition of the covariance matrix, and Graphical HAR (GHAR)-DRD, which is also based on DRD decomposition but also makes use of graphical relationships between the assets.

Then it is typically the case that \(A\) can be well-approximated by a low-rank matrix. For instance, using the previous example, there might only be a few dominant patterns that describes purchasing behavior in \(A\), and the rest of it is just noise.Therefore, if we can find such a low-rank approximation, we can achieve significant space savings, and can also help to make the data more interpretable. In this post, we explore how affine embeddings via the CountSketch matrix allows us to perform low rank approximation in time \(O\left(\nnz{A}+(n+d) \text{poly} \left( \frac{k}{\epsilon} \right)\right)\).",

      description: "Many machine learning algorithms have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial examples. For example, image classification neural networks can wrongly classify an image when a small perturbation, unnoticeable to the human eye, is added to the original image which it has previously correctly classified. The goal of an adversarial attack can thus be rephrased as an optimization problem to compute the &quot;smallest&quot; perturbation needed, such that the perturbed example will be misclassified.",

It caught my eye because of its versatility and utility in reverse engineering binaries whose disassembly and decompilation are hard to understand manually. Oftentimes, it is simply due to the fact that it was compiled from newer or relatively less popular languages like Rust or Haskell, where the state of currently publicly available decompilers leaves much to be desired. Angr&#39;s ability to perform symbolic execution therefore allows us to blackbox certain functionality within the program (or even the entire program) by attempting to find the right input for a desired output.",

We use a pre-trained GPT-2 model and perform fine-tuning on 5 different subreddits, and use different methods of ordering the training data based on our priors about the input to see how this affects the prediction quality of the trained model. We propose a new metric for evaluating causal language modeling tasks called APES (Average Perplexity Evaluation for Sentences) to address the limitations of existing metrics, and apply them to our results. Our results are evaluated against both LSTM and GPT-2 baselines.",

For example, we can efficiently find a certificate for inequality of multivariate polynomials pseudo-deterministically, but it is not known how to do so deterministically. The same notion can be extended to the streaming model. The problem of finding a nonzero element from a turnstile stream is previously shown to require linear space for both deterministic and pseudo-deterministic algorithms. Another model of streaming problems is that of graphs, where edge insertions and deletions occur along a stream. Some natural problems include connectivity, bipartiteness, and colorability of a graph. While the randomized and deterministic graph streaming algorithms have been mostly well-studied, we investigate pseudo-deterministic space lower bounds and upper bounds for graph theoretic streaming problems.",

We investigate if policies learnt by agents using the OBL algorithm in the multi-player cooperative game Hanabi in the zero-shot coordination (ZSC) context are invariant across symmetries of the game, and if any conventions formed during training are arbitrary or natural, both of which are desirable properties.",
