This post assumes that the reader has some working knowledge of LaTeX.</p> <h2 id="typesetting-as-a-form-of-art">Typesetting as a Form of Art</h2> <p>It is important to get into the right mindset whenever you typeset a document. You are not simply “writing” a document — you are crafting a work of art that combines both the precision and creativity of your logical thinking, as well as the elegance of a beautifully typeset writing. The amount of attention and care you put into the presentation is indicative of the amount of thought you put into the content. Therefore, having good style is not only delightful and aesthetically pleasing to read, but it also serves to establish your ethos and character. One can tell that someone puts a lot of effort into their work and takes great pride in them when they pay attention even to the smallest of details.</p> <p>Furthermore, adopting good practices also helps to avoid you making typographical mistakes in your proof, such as missing parenthesis or wrong positioning. This could often lead to cascading errors that are very annoying to fix when you discover them later on. There are ways to replicate the strict typechecking of statically typed languages to ensure that mistakes in your expressions can be caught at compile-time.</p> <h2 id="common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them">Common Mistakes, and How To Fix Them</h2> <p>In the following section, we take a look at common mistakes that people make, and how they can be avoided or fixed. We cover style mistakes first, since the ideas behind them are more general. All the screenshotted examples come from peer-reviewed papers that have been published to top conferences, so they are definitely very common mistakes and you shouldn’t feel bad for making them. The important thing is that you are aware of them now so that your style will gradually improve over time.</p> <h2 id="style-mistakes">Style Mistakes</h2> <p>We take a look at style mistakes, which impairs reader understanding, and makes it easy to commit other sorts of errors.</p> <h3 id="paired-delimiters">Paired Delimiters</h3> <p>Parenthesis, brackets, and pipes are examples of delimiters that are used to mark the start and end of formula expressions. As they come in pairs, a common mistake is accidentally leaving out the closing delimiter, especially for nested expressions. Even if you don’t forget to do so, there is the issue of incorrect sizing.</p> <p>For instance, consider the following way of expressing the Topologist’s sine curve, which is an example of a topology that is connected but not path connected:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex">T = <span class="k">\{</span> ( x, <span class="k">\sin</span> <span class="k">\frac</span><span class="p">{</span>1<span class="p">}{</span>x<span class="p">}</span> ) : x <span class="k">\in</span> (0, 1] <span class="k">\}</span> <span class="k">\cup</span> <span class="k">\{</span> ( 0, 0 ) <span class="k">\}</span></code></pre></figure> <p>which is rendered as follows:</p> \[T = \{(x, \sin \frac{1}{x} ) : x \in (0, 1] \} \cup \{ ( 0, 0 ) \}\] <p>The problem here is that the curly braces have the wrong size, as they should be large enough to cover the \(\sin \frac{1}{x}\) expression vertically.</p> <p>The wrong way of resolving this would be to use delimiter size modifiers, i.e <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\bigl, \Bigl, \biggl</code> paired with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\bigr, \Bigr, \biggr</code> and the like. This is tedious and error-prone, since it will even happily let you match delimiters with different sizes. Indeed, I came across the following formula in a paper recently, where the outer right square brackets was missing and the left one had the wrong size:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim.webp-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim.webp-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim.webp-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim.webp" class="z-depth-1" width="500px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> What happens when you don't use paired delimiters </figcaption> </figure> <p>The correct way to do this would be to use paired delimiters, which will automatically adjust its size based on its contents, and automatically result in a compile error if the matching right delimiter is not included, or nested at the wrong level. Some of them are given below:</p> <table class="table table-bordered table-sm"> <thead> <tr> <th>Raw LaTeX</th> <th>Rendered</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) </code></td> <td>\(\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left[ \frac{1}{x} \right] </code></td> <td>\(\left[ \frac{1}{x} \right]\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \right\} </code></td> <td>\(\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \right\}\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left\lvert \frac{1}{x} \right\lvert </code></td> <td>\(\left\lvert \frac{1}{x} \right\rvert\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left\lceil \frac{1}{x} \right\rceil </code></td> <td>\(\left\lceil \frac{1}{x} \right\rceil\)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In fact, to make things even simpler and more readable, you can declare paired delimiters for use based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mathtools</code> package, with the following commands due to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ryan O’Donnell</a>:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="c">% Make sure you include \usepackage{mathtools}</span>

This is pretty unfortunate as it still makes it error-prone. There is a <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1742/automatic-left-and-right-commands/1744#1744" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">proposed solution</a> floating around on StackExchange that relies on a custom command that makes auto-resizing the default, but it’s still a far cry from a parsimonious solution.</p> <h3 id="macros-for-saving-time-and-preventing-mistakes">Macros for Saving Time and Preventing Mistakes</h3> <p>Macros can be defined using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\newcommand</code> command. The basic syntax is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\newcommand{command_name}{command_definition}</code>. For instance, it might get tiring to always type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\boldsymbol{A}</code> to refer to a matrix \(\boldsymbol{A}\), so you can use the following macro:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="c">% Macro</span>
<span class="k">\newcommand</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\bA</span><span class="p">}{</span><span class="k">\boldsymbol</span><span class="p">{</span>A<span class="p">}}</span>

This is done by adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[n]</code> argument after your command name, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is the number of arguments that it should take. You can then reference the positional arguments using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#1, #2,</code> and so on. Here, we create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\dotprod</code> macro that takes two arguments:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="c">% Macros</span>

However, they can also be used to help to catch mistakes when typesetting grammatically structured things.</p> <p>For instance, when expressing types and terms in programming language theory, there is often a lot of nested syntactical structure, which could make it easy to make mistakes. Consider the following proof:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/macros.webp-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/macros.webp-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/macros.webp-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/macros.webp" class="z-depth-1" width="600px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> A proof with a lot of syntactical structure </figcaption> </figure> <p>The details are unimportant, but it is clear that it is easy to miss a letter here or a term there in the proof, given how cumbersome the notation is. To avoid this, I used the following macros, due to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Harper</a>:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="k">\newcommand</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\inval</span><span class="p">}</span>[2]<span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\in</span><span class="p">^{</span>(#1)<span class="p">}_</span><span class="k">\mathsf</span><span class="p">{</span>val<span class="p">}</span> #2<span class="p">}</span>
