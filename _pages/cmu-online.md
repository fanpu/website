Education and knowledge should be accessible to anyone who is willing to learn.
There are many great course offerings from the top-ranked Computer Science
program in Carnegie Mellon University whose lectures are available on the public
domain. The purpose of this page is to curate these courses, so people can learn
from the best professors in the world without the hefty college price tag.

Courses which are accessible to undergraduates will have a
<span class="badge rounded-pill undergraduate"> </span> tag.
This does not mean that the difficulty is not suitable for graduate students;
on the contrary, almost all such classes are cross-listed as graduate courses
and are commonly taken by graduate students at CMU. There are also some
graduate classes (based on the course number) which are suitable for advanced
undergraduates which I marked as undergraduate as well.
Classes that require significant background and which are less accessible will
have a <span class="badge rounded-pill graduate"> </span> tag.

Some courses are only publicly available on Panopto instead of Youtube, in which
case I provided a link to the Panopto playlist. Don't feel too sad that this is
the case, because it can be more conducive to use Panopto than Youtube due to
the ability to customize speaker and presentation view.

Within each category, the courses are not ordered in any particular
way that is indicative of difficulty or the order in which they
should be considered. Consider them to be arbitrary.

Please let me know if there are any dead links, or if you spot an error with the
page. In addition, if there are courses that I missed which might be useful for
others, you can either modify the [relevant data file
here](https://github.com/fanpu/website/blob/master/_data/cmu_online.yml) and
make a pull request, or let me know via email. I will very much appreciate it!

The list of courses available publicly is heavily skewed towards which
departments or faculty members make their lecture recordings publicly available,
and therefore omits a lot of classes that Computer Science majors in CMU tend to
take. In particular, courses from the following departments in the School of
Computer Science are either not present, or severely under-represented:
Human-Computer Interaction,

### Programming Language Theory
Unfortunately, there are not a lot of publicly available programming language
(PL) theory lectures. However, [Robert Harper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/) and
[Jan Hoffmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/), staples of the PL scene in CMU,
both frequently give lectures for the [Oregon Programming Languages Summer
School](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/) that are much smaller
in scope than what is covered in a comparable full-semester course in CMU, but
still goes through many key ideas nonetheless.  Therefore, I have also decided
to include these resources than not have anything, which would be a shame as
CMU is a powerhouse in PL after all.

Why are so many courses titled 15-819? This is because the course number
is a catch-all for advanced topics in PL theory, so while the course name
is the same, the content can vary.

### Mathematics and Statistics
In general, the math department does not record any of their lectures, so
this portion is pretty dry. However, it was worth having it just
to include [Po-Shen Loh](https://www.poshenloh.com/)'s lectures.
He coaches the USA IMO team and is a very engaging teacher.
